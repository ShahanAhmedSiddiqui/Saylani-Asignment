    <h1 id="category1"><u>FISH</u></h1>

    <figcaption>All fishes have a spinal cord and most breathe through the gills,
        ve wings and scales. Fishes have an excellent sense of sight,
        touch, taste, smell and a good sense of 'hearing'.
        There are 25,000 known species of fish. The smallest
        fish is the Paedocypris which is less than 1/3 inch when
        fully grown. A fish is an animal which lives and breathes in water.
        All fish are vertebrates (have a backbone) and most breathe through
        gills and have fins and scales. Fish make up about half of all
        known vertebrate species. Fish have been on the earth for more
        than 500 million years. </figcaption> <br />

    <h1 id="category2"><u>AMPHIBIANS</u></h1>

    <figcaption> Amphibians form a class of vertebrates.
        Vertebrates are animals that have backbones their
        surround their nerve cords. The nerve cord is found
        along the back of the animal. The bodies of most
        vertebrates have a head and a trunk. Many vertebrates
        have two pairs of limbs attached to the trunk.
        Amphibians go through a two-stage life cycle. They are
        laid in water or a damp environment to keep from drying
        out. They experience a metamorphosis or change in
        appearance from the baby to adult. When an amphibian
        hatches, it is in a gilled larva form. In frogs and
        toads this larva is called a tadpole.</figcaption> <br />

        <h1 id="category3"><u>REPTILES</u></h1>

        <figcaption>The reptile is a member of the creeping
            class of cold-blooded animals with a backbone
            and relatively short legs or no legs at all.
            Snakes, crocodiles, lizards, tortoises etc.
            fall in the category of reptiles. A reptile
            crawls or moves on its belly or on short
            legs. The snakes move on the belly, while
            a lizard on short legs. Its body is usually
            covered with scales and bony plates. A reptile
            eats small animals like fishes, frogs, etc.
            Some of the reptiles are extremely poisonous.
            For example, a snake which resembles a rope,
            and which can be one foot to ten or twelve
            feet long is very dangerous. Its poison can
            take a human life. Its head is small, with two small bright
            open eyes. </figcaption> <br />

        <h1 id="category4"><u>Birds</u></h1>

        <figcaption>Birds are those living beings that can fly high in the sky.
            Birds have big feathers that help them to lift their bodies in
            the air. There are hundreds of types of birds on Earth and each
            of them is unique. For example, the peacock has a magnificent
            tail made of beautiful feathers, the parrot is a bird that can
            learn to talk, crow is the smartest in bird kingdom, a
            hummingbird can sing, nightingale bird is also known for its
            melodious voice. Like this each bird is different in its
            abilities and looks.</figcaption> <br />

        <h1 id="category5"><u>MAMMALS</u></h1>

        <figcaption>A mammal is an animal that breathes air, has a backbone,
            and grows hair at some point during its life. In addition, all
            female mammals have glands that can produce milk. Mammals are
            among the most intelligent of all living creatures. Mammals
            include a wide variety of animals, from cats to humans to whales.
            There are more than 5,000 species, or kinds, of living mammal.
            More than half of all mammals are rodents, a group that
            includes mice and squirrels. Mammals are found in every major
            habitat around the world. Most mammals live on land—on the
            ground, in trees, or even underground. Some mammals—including
            otters, beavers, and seals—live on land and in the water.
            Whales, dolphins, and manatees are mammals that spend
            their whole life in water.</figcaption> <br />
