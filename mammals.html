        <figcaption>A mammal is an animal that breathes air, has a backbone,
            and grows hair at some point during its life. In addition, all
            female mammals have glands that can produce milk. Mammals are
            among the most intelligent of all living creatures. Mammals
            include a wide variety of animals, from cats to humans to whales.
            There are more than 5,000 species, or kinds, of living mammal.
            More than half of all mammals are rodents, a group that
            includes mice and squirrels. Mammals are found in every major
            habitat around the world. Most mammals live on land—on the
            ground, in trees, or even underground. Some mammals—including
            otters, beavers, and seals—live on land and in the water.
            Whales, dolphins, and manatees are mammals that spend
            their whole life in water.</figcaption> <br />
