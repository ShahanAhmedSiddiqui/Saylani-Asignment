        <figcaption>Birds are those living beings that can fly high in the sky.
            Birds have big feathers that help them to lift their bodies in
            the air. There are hundreds of types of birds on Earth and each
            of them is unique. For example, the peacock has a magnificent
            tail made of beautiful feathers, the parrot is a bird that can
            learn to talk, crow is the smartest in bird kingdom, a
            hummingbird can sing, nightingale bird is also known for its
            melodious voice. Like this each bird is different in its
            abilities and looks.</figcaption> <br />

        <figcaption>A mammal is an animal that breathes air, has a backbone,
            and grows hair at some point during its life. In addition, all
            female mammals have glands that can produce milk. Mammals are
            among the most intelligent of all living creatures. Mammals
            include a wide variety of animals, from cats to humans to whales.
            There are more than 5,000 species, or kinds, of living mammal.
            More than half of all mammals are rodents, a group that
            includes mice and squirrels. Mammals are found in every major
            habitat around the world. Most mammals live on land—on the
            ground, in trees, or even underground. Some mammals—including
            otters, beavers, and seals—live on land and in the water.
            Whales, dolphins, and manatees are mammals that spend
            their whole life in water.</figcaption> <br />
