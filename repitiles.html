        <h1 id="category3"><u>REPTILES</u></h1>

        <figcaption>The reptile is a member of the creeping
            class of cold-blooded animals with a backbone
            and relatively short legs or no legs at all.
            Snakes, crocodiles, lizards, tortoises etc.
            fall in the category of reptiles. A reptile
            crawls or moves on its belly or on short
            legs. The snakes move on the belly, while
            a lizard on short legs. Its body is usually
            covered with scales and bony plates. A reptile
            eats small animals like fishes, frogs, etc.
            Some of the reptiles are extremely poisonous.
            For example, a snake which resembles a rope,
            and which can be one foot to ten or twelve
            feet long is very dangerous. Its poison can
            take a human life. Its head is small, with two small bright
            open eyes. </figcaption> <br />

        <figcaption>A mammal is an animal that breathes air, has a backbone,
            and grows hair at some point during its life. In addition, all
            female mammals have glands that can produce milk. Mammals are
            among the most intelligent of all living creatures. Mammals
            include a wide variety of animals, from cats to humans to whales.
            There are more than 5,000 species, or kinds, of living mammal.
            More than half of all mammals are rodents, a group that
            includes mice and squirrels. Mammals are found in every major
            habitat around the world. Most mammals live on land—on the
            ground, in trees, or even underground. Some mammals—including
            otters, beavers, and seals—live on land and in the water.
            Whales, dolphins, and manatees are mammals that spend
            their whole life in water.</figcaption> <br />
